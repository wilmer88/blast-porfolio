          <div class="float-left">
            Hello, my name is Wilmer Rivera. Im from honduras.
           Right now my residance is in a small city called Rome, GA
            
           <p> Im taking this new path as a new  web develper to challange my self and abilities.
            I always take  pride in the work that I do and im very critical of myself.
            I'm fery aware that hard work almost always has a reward. Im happy and more than willing to
            to work hard to give everybody besides myself satisfaction that hard work rewards
            , and treat the project/company that 
            Im working in for as my own.</p>
          </div>
         
          <img
            src="assets/css/images/me.jpg"
            class="profilepic"
            alt="foto of wilmer rivera"
          />

          <p>
            and Im alway looking to see thing for what they are and if needed to
            take action and correct the situation. But I digress.
          </p>
          <p>
            How i look at my self is as a workhorse as long as my fam is taken
            care with the best, the best will be given by the horse, thanks for
            reading this, and for your time.
